  # The TypeMaps module holds all typemaps that ship with libsql.  They
  # currently are:
  #
  # DefaultMap:: does a 'best-guess' mapping to convert as many types as
  #              possible to known ruby classes from known SQL types.
  # StorageMap:: converts to a limited set of classes directly based 
  #              upon the SQLite storage types
  # TextMap::    Everything is Text ... everything everything everything
